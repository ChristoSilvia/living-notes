<h1>The Wave Equation</h1>

<hr />

<p>Imagine a system of masses on strings, with the strings having a tension T. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Is the tension uniform throughout the string?</em></p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>For now, it is. We are using this model to build up to the continous case</em>
    <em>so we'll assume it's the same for now.  Later, we can incorporate the</em>
    <em>varying tension into the partial differential equation.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>They all do things.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now we're taking the continous limit of the previous, which gets us a partial differential equation:</p>

<p>ytt = v^2 yxx</p>

<p>Notice, any function which depends only on x+vt will satisfy this equation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Can I ask in differnt places?</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Can I ask in differnt places?</em></p>

<p>For us to
get a better model for standing waves, we have to introduce some boundary conditions.</p>
