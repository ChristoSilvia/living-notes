The Wave Equation
=================

Imagine a system of masses on strings, with the strings having a tension T.

They all do things.

Now we're taking the continous limit of the previous, which gets us a partial differential equation:

ytt = v^2 yxx

Notice, any function which depends only on x+vt will satisfy this equation.

> _Can I ask in differnt places?_

 For us to
get a better model for standing waves, we have to introduce some boundary conditions.
